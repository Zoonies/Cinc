# Cinc - Correlation is not Causation

## Description

Our project addresses problems facing our planet by providing a way to showcase the significance of these problems to individuals. We give our users a delightful way to gain insights about how external factors such as weather, crime, air quality, friend-circle sentiment, the news, climate change, etc. impact their feeling of well-being over time.

Cinc is designed as an app that integrates environmental and epidemiological data with simple biometrics over time. The idea is that you'd take what ever your phone gives you (e.g. activity data from the pensitometer), data streams like pollen count and air/water quality, crime stats, traffic info, etc and then combine it with a simple reocurring prompt from the app to rate how you feel on a scale of 1-5.
